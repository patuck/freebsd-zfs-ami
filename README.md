# FreeBSD ZFS AMI

This repository explains the steps and scripts used to build a stock [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) AMI image that uses ZFS as its file system instead of UFS.  
This will be as close as possible to the upstream [FreeBSD AMI images](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=92bb514d-02bc-49fd-9727-c474863f63da&ref=dtl_B07L6QV354) as possible.
